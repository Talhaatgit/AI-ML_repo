# Python Fundamentals – Output, Input, Variables, Data Types and Operators

This section contains introductory Python programs designed for beginners who intend to build strong foundational knowledge before advancing into higher-level Python programming, Artificial Intelligence, and Machine Learning concepts.  
Each file focuses on a specific concept and demonstrates the correct usage through simple examples.

This section is currently in progress and additional programs will be added as required.

## Concepts Covered

1. Displaying output using the `print()` function  
2. Accepting user input using the `input()` function  
3. Understanding variables and dynamic typing  
4. Introduction to basic data types (`int`, `float`, `str`, `bool`)  
5. Type conversion using built-in functions (`int()`, `float()`, `str()`)  
6. Introduction to arithmetic, comparison, logical, and assignment operators

## Learning Objectives

Upon completing this section, learners should be able to:

- Use the `print()` and `input()` functions appropriately  
- Declare, assign and modify variables  
- Identify and use basic Python data types correctly  
- Convert data from one type to another where necessary  
- Apply arithmetic, comparison, logical and assignment operators  
- Interpret basic program output and understand the underlying logic

## Recommendation for Learners

Learners are encouraged to modify all code samples, experiment with different values, and observe output changes to strengthen their conceptual understanding. Practice and experimentation are recommended for effective learning.
